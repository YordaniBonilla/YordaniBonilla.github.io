  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I was born in Tepic, Nayarit, lived in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Marquezado,+Nayarit/@21.0769444,-104.5716666,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipNgW4g5zXB2ZnR2pSlgvoMFjh3LZ8m-_F87fjAX!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipNgW4g5zXB2ZnR2pSlgvoMFjh3LZ8m-_F87fjAX%3Dw203-h270-k-no!7i3120!8i4160!4m5!3m4!1s0x8426e68c1c0d14e5:0x39ae07026d4a34e9!8m2!3d21.0769444!4d-104.5716666#">Marquezado</a> a small ranch. When I was 6 my dad immigrated to the U.S.A., 2 years later we moved to California for a while then moved to Washington State where we would settle down for a while. There I went to <em>JJ smith</em> elementary after that <em>Enumclaw Middle</em> and finally <em>Enumclaw High School</em>. After leaving school I got experience at my first job washing cars it was neat, easy job good money and I also got to drive a mustang!. Then I decided to leave the U.S. and return to Mexico, my life wasn't easy, don't think anyones is. So I returned to Mexico and lived in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Heriberto+Jara,+Nayarit/@21.0518781,-104.5181397,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x8426e5760965e3b7:0x581c39a1e8a0da0c!8m2!3d21.0519444!4d-104.5172222">H. Jara</a> with my grandma. The work was <strong>hard</strong>. They pay was <strong>bad</strong>. But it was a change from the life in the us. Here I had all the freedom I could go anywhere without worrying about getting in trouble and getting deported. I moved to Tijuana city for a while to work in call centers because I heard the pay was good. I didn't like it one bit. Later I just moved back to the ranch now living in H. Jara.</p></div>
